		<h1>Contextual Inquiry</h1>
		
		<h2>Why this project?</h2>
		<p>I became interested in ASL (American Sign Language) after meeting a few people in the Deaf community. 
		I decided to learn ASL because it bothered me that I had no way to communicate with the Deaf.
		I wanted to live in a world where more people learned sign language and the Hearing and Deaf could communicate as regularly as the Hearing. 
		To my suprise, there was not a single useful or modern website that taught ASL. 
		After spending 1 year learning from books at my local library and occasional practice with a signing friend, I came up with an idea for a much needed online resource for learning the language.</p>
				
		<h2>Analyzing the Current Situation</h2>
		<p>During my journey to teach myself American Sign Language, I analyzed a variety of digital and physical resources on the web and at my local library. 
		Finding a single website that taught ASL vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure was difficult to find. 
		Existing websites that attempted to teach all of these subject were plagued with design issues making it unpleassant and difficult to learn.   		
		The websites I discovered from Google’s top search results contained the following issues:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Weak Information Architecture</li>
			<li>Poor Search Functionality</li>
			<li>Slow Learning Capabilities</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>User Research</h2>
		<p>By being conveniently located near Gallaudet University, a federally chartered university for the education of the Deaf, I had better access to
		those who have learned American Sign Language than anywhere in the country. 
		I needed to understand how people learn ASL outside of my own personal experiences. 
		I prepared some research questions, journied to a familiar campus setting, and interviewed students. 
		I sought out how users learned the language, what difficulties they faced, and tips for others wanting to learn the language.
		By researching their learning experiences, I could better understand their user needs. </p>

		<h2>Requirements Extraction</h2>
		<p>Constructing a WAAD (Work Activity Affinity Diagram) is one of my favorite exercises in a UX lifecycle process. 
		To begin, I converted the contextual data I gathered from user research into work activity notes. 
		I grouped these notes into relaed issues and themes and applied labels to each group.
		I analyzed the completed WAAD and formed requirement statements, each one focusing on a partular user need or system function. 
		Below is a sample requirement statement that was created.</p>

		<h2>Primary Goals</h2>
		<p>My goal was to provide people beginning to learn ASL with a complete guide to the language in a user friendly way. 
		I also wanted to improve on the issues found in existing websites by having better navigation, more exploration, and faster learning capabilities.
		Most importantly, the website needed to be usable and provide beginner ASL learners with a useful..... </p>

		<h1>User Models</h1>
		
		<h2>Who are the Users?</h2>
		<p>The primary work role of the website is the <i>Beginner ASL Learner</i>.
		The two major user tasks of this work role are (1) to learn signs and (2) to learn the syntax of the language in order to string signs together and form sentences.
		Because this work role has such a broad user population, it requires multiple user class definitions to describe all the different kinds of people that can assume this role. 
		I researched the <i>Beginner ASL Learner</i> work role and identified the most popular user classes. These include:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Friends and Family Members of Deaf People</li>
			<li>Elderly Suffering from Late-Stage Hearing Loss</li>
			<li>Language Enthusiasts</li>
		</ul>	
	
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>I considered what the design might look like for each of my user classes in order to identify a primary persona. 
		Designing a website with font size large enough for the Elderly to read was an important design consideration that would not negatively impact the other personas.
		Since all of the user classes have such similar goals, I selected <i>Elderly Suffering from Late-Stage Hearing Loss</i> as my primary persona.</p>

		<h2>User Flow & Navigation Design</h2>
		<p>Signs and Syntax are the 2 main components of ASL. I wanted to keep these two separate in order to accomodate the two major user tasks.
		I designed a system that would allow users to freely switch between these tasks.
		The page dedicated to learning signs includes a preview of syntax lessons with links to webpages containing more information on the syntax. 
		These syntax webpages includes example ASL phrases where each sign in the phrase contains a link to it's associated webpage.</p>

		<h2>Analyzing Designs</h2>
		<p>I looked for the best design that would meet the users goals and the primary goals of the system. 
		My first few designs were not the best in meeting these goals. 
		Only after iterative cyles of UX evaluation and design refinement was I confident that I was on the right track to creating the right design.</p>

		<h1>Information Architecture</h1>
		
		<h2>Design of Information</h2>
		<p>The website is designed such that when a user is interested in learning a particular ASL sign, 
		he/she is able to find related signs that categorically belong together. 
		For example, when the user is learning the sign for TODAY, he/she is able to learn the sign for YESTERDAY with a single click 
		since these signs both belong in the “time” category. Grouping signs into categories gives structure to the website, 
		and provides easy learning and fast findability.</p>
		
		<h2>Searchability & Findability</h2>
		<p>I developed an information architecture for the website such that the content is findable and searchable. 
		To have good findability, a search bar is a part of the site’s global navigation where users are able to search for any ASL sign. 
		A page exists for each category of signs, and contextual navigation provides a list of the categories at all times.
		<br></br>
		To have good searchability, users need to be able to easily find information from an unknown location, such as Google. 
		Since web pages exist for each category of sign and not to any individual sign, I anticipated this would create poor searchability in the Google search results. 
		URLs such as <b>theASLguide.com/category/time</b> might look irrelevant in the search results to someone who searched for “today ASL sign”. 
		I found a good way around this issue by using the description attribute within the meta tag for each web page.  
		All of the signs that fall into a certain category will be included in this tag and therefore will be displayed as part of the Google search result.</p>

		<h2>Labels</h2>
		<p>The primary method for grouping signs together into categories and then labeling each category was through Card Sorting. 
		Check out the UX Evaluation section below for a unique strategy for creating categories for hundreds of ASL vocabulary words.</p>

		<h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
		<p><i>Current state of the system is easily understood by the user.</i> 
		I discovered an issue with this heuristic. Users may not easily understand what webpage they are looking at under certain circumstances.
		The method for indicating what category of signs is being displayed can become out of view due to “The Fold” of the website, 
		the theoretical horizontal line of a webpage below which the content of a web page is not visible without scrolling. 
		My solution was to have the category written out and displayed at the top of the webpage. 
		Here is a before and after picture:</p>
